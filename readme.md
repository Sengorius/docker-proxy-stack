## What is the Docker-Proxy-Stack?

The docker proxy stack is primarily a toolkit for local web development that
supports

1. SSL (`https://`) for all local projects.
1. descriptive names instead of `localhost`.
1. running multiple projects at the same time
    - sharing database containers (MySQL, PostgreSQL & Redis)
    - sharing certificates
    - sharing a mailcatcher
    - sharing a reverse proxy
      (thus not blocking port 80/443)
1. easy initial setup
1. DB administration with PhpMyAdmin and Adminer
1. catching E-Mails via SMTP with mailcatcher

Its tools are based on the [nginx-proxy](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/nginx-proxy)
from Jason Wilder and his contributors.


### So why do we do all this?

If you are running multiple web applications on one machine at the same time 
you are running into a couple of issues.  
If your projects are already dockerized, every `docker-compose` file will

- run their own webserver
- run their own database
- use probaby the same port for each of those.

You also have to manage SSL certificates for each project.

The solution the Docker proxy stack provides is taking care of all shared
ressources. So

- run a reverse proxy to manage all projects web-servers
- run one database server
- provide a custom certificate
- run DBA tools like PMA or Adminer
- run a mailcatcher
- and set all of it up in a conveniant way with `DockerExec`.


## Installation

To make sure, anythin will run fine, a unix based system is necessary. Things
might work with Windows, but it was never tested to do so.

You will also need `docker`, `docker-compose`, `openssl`, `git` and a bash
on you local machine. As all tasks are made for bash, a zsh or similar shells
will work, too.

### First setup

Clone the repository somewhere to your machine. Make a copy of the `.env.template`
and save it as `.env` into the same folder. (Windows uses a different `SOCKET_PATH`,
all other variables should be fine.)

Use a shell within the project directory
and add execution rights to `DockerExec` with `chmod +x DockerExec`. Then type
`./DockerExec` to promt for the installation instructions for `DockerExec`. Follow
the instructions, close and reopen a shell to make it work.

If the shell script was installed correctly, type `DockerExec help` to get a list of
tasks, the `DockerExec` can do for you.

You need to belong to the `sudo` group, as `DockerExec` has to update the `/etc/hosts`
file, in order to match the network for your projects.

Run `DockerExec init-certs` and follow the prompts. This should create multiple
certificates in the `certs` folder, containing a `rootCA.crt`. Any info you type
into the prompts is optional. In the next step, you have to register this self-signed
certificate to your default browser.

#### Using the Proxy-Stack on MacOS

The library `realpath` is mandatory for `DockerExec` to work with local files. You have
to install the `coreutils` to get that library. With Homebrew installed, use 
`brew install coreutils`.

Read further on [how to install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

#### Install the rootCA to Firefox

Go to `Settings -> Security` and scroll to the bottom, then click `Show Certificates`.  
In the tab `certificate authorities` click `import`, navigate to the
aforementioned `/certs` folder and select `rootCA.crt` to import. Select both checkboxes
and confirm.

#### Install the rootCA to Chrome or Chromium

In `Settings -> Manage certificates -> Authorities`. Navigate to the
aforementioned `/certs` folder and select `rootCA.crt` to import.

#### Sidenotes

If you do not want to use the `DockerExec`, another network has to be created for the
proxy containers. The variable `NETWORK_NAME` in `.env` represents that network name all 
containers in this stack have to register in.  

Use `docker network create --attachable "{YOUR_NETWORK_NAME}"` once to create
the network. Don't change it afterwards. You can now test if the network was created with  
`docker network ls`.

Don't forget to add `127.0.0.1 docker.test` to your `/etc/hosts` (`sudo` necessary) file,
which docker will use to redirect the requests on your local machine.


## How to add Projects to the Docker Proxy Network

The main goal here is to add multiple projects, that are dockerized, to the same
proxy network

1. `DockerExec` expects a `docker-compose.y(a)ml` file that contains nginx and all 
   other services you might need for your project (sans DB / BDA tool)  
   Configure nginx like this:
    ``` yaml
    nginx:
        image: nginx:latest
        container_name: ${CON_PREFIX}-web
        expose:
            - 80
            - 443
        volumes:
            - .:/var/www/html 
        environment: 
            # choose a docker.test subdomain
            VIRTUAL_HOST: my-project.docker.test
            VIRTUAL_PORT: 443
            VIRTUAL_PROTO: https
   ```
   `my-project` should be your project name.
1. Specify the Docker network you created above in `docker-compose.yml`:
    ```yaml
    services:
       # ...
   
    networks:
        default:
            external: true
            name: ${NETWORK_NAME}
    ```
1. You also need a `.env` file to specify at least `CON_PREFIX`
1. Add a hostname specific to your project: `VIRTUAL_HOST` has to be added to you hosts file.  
   Add the following line once for every project:  
   `127.0.0.1 VIRTUAL_HOST`
1. Try it out:  
   Run `docker-compose up -d` and in your browser of choice browse to `VIRTUAL_HOST`


## Docker-Proxy-Stack Update

1. Simply use `DockerExec self-update`.
1. read new release notes
1. follow instructions in this `readme.md`

### Manual update

In the root directory of this repository 

1. run `git fetch --tags && REVLIST=$(git rev-list --tags --max-count=1) && git checkout $(git describe --tags $REVLIST)`
1. read new release notes
1. follow instructions in this `readme.md`


## E-Mail Catching

Part of this stack is the Mailcatcher which catches all mails sent via SMTP. The
mailcatcher runs at `https://mailcatcher.docker.test/`

Current use-cases include mails sent by **Symfony** and **WordPress**.

### Symfony

In your projects `.env` file set `MAILER_DSN=smtp://mailcatcher:25`. That's it.

### WordPress

Two options:

1. Install the Plugin **WP Mail SMTP**, use the option "Other SMTP" and set the
   variable "SMTP HOST" to `proxy-smtp` and "SMTP Port" to `25`, deactivate
   "Auto TLS", deactivate "Authentication".
1. Create your own plugin with this code snippet:

```php
<?php
/**
 * Proxy SMTP Adapter
 *
 * @package nginx-proxy
 * @license GPLv3
 *
 * @wordpress-plugin
 * Plugin Name: Proxy SMTP Adapter
 * Description: Configure WordPress to send emails to the Mailcatcher available at the host name "proxy-smtp"
 * Version: 1.0.0
 * Text Domain: nginx-proxy
 * License: GPLv3
 * License URI: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt
 */

/**
 * Configure WordPress to send emails to the Mailcatcher available at the host name "proxy-smtp".
 *
 * @param PHPMailer $phpmailer The PHPMailer instance.
 */
function proxy_smtp_config( $phpmailer ) {
	$phpmailer->isSMTP();
	$phpmailer->Host     = 'proxy-smtp';
	$phpmailer->SMTPAuth = false;
	$phpmailer->Port     = 25;
}
add_action( 'phpmailer_init', 'proxy_smtp_config' );

```


## DockerExec

To simplify most of the aforementioned tasks and add additional functionality
for usual interactions with the Docker-Proxy-Stack, we provice the Bash script
`DockerExec`.

### Additional Advantages

1. Concise commands for Docker and Docker-Compose.
1. Perform additional tasks like stopping all local Docker containers or remove
   images.
1. Update local `/etc/hosts` automatically.
1. Synchronize the containers `/etc/hosts` files automatically.
1. Starting up a project will print the projects domain to your command line.

### How to install DockerExec?

1. Run the script with `./path/to/DockerExec`.
1. Follow the instructions provided by `DockerExec`.

### How to use DockerExec?

1. If you already setup step 1 - 3 of "How to add Projects to the Docker Proxy
   Network" you are all set.
1. Try and follow `DockerExec help`.

### Limitations of DockerExec

At this point some variables and configuration are hard coded and have to be 
set manually for a new project.  
You also need Bash. `/bin/sh` will not suffice.

1. Your projects Docker-Compose file has to have the name
   `docker-compose.proxy.y(a)ml`.
   - Depending on your environment there can also be a
     `docker-compose.prod.y(a)ml` or for a single Compose file
     `docker-compose.y(a)ml`. These are not suited for local dev environments.
1. You have to provide a `.env` file in your project root to set necessary
   variables. A best practice would be to have a version-controlled
   `.env.template` which you copy over to `.env` and customize on deployment.

### A Minimal Configuration for PHP

Some environment variables cannot be read from the `.env` file and have to be
manually added to the container under `environment`. E.g. the domain name.

```yaml
# docker-compose.proxy.yml
version: '3.5'

services:
    web:
        image: ${WEB_IMAGE}
        container_name: ${CON_PREFIX}-web
        env_file: .env
        volumes:
            - .:/var/www/html
        expose:
            - 80
            - 443
        environment:
            VIRTUAL_HOST: my-project.docker.test
            VIRTUAL_PORT: 443
            VIRTUAL_PROTO: https
        links:
            - php

    php:
        image: ${PHP_IMAGE}
        container_name: ${CON_PREFIX}-app
        env_file: .env
        volumes:
            - .:/var/www/html

networks:
    default:
        external: true
        name: ${NETWORK}
```

```
# .env

# on a Windows machine
# convert windows path to linux in docker-compose
COMPOSE_CONVERT_WINDOWS_PATHS=1

# docker-compose configuration
CON_PREFIX=project # prefix name for the running docker container
PHP_IMAGE={$CONTAINER_REGISTRY}/symfony/flex/php:7.4-fpm-dev
WEB_IMAGE={$CONTAINER_REGISTRY}/symfony/flex/nginx:latest
NETWORK=nginx-proxy

### specific to your project
# MySQL configuration
MYSQL_HOST=proxy-db
MYSQL_PORT=3306
MYSQL_USER=root
MYSQL_DATABASE=my_project_db
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root

# or PostgreSQL configuration
POSTGRES_HOST=proxy-pg
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_USER=root
POSTGRES_DB=my_project_db
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=root
```
