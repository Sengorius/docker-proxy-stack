# What is the Docker-Proxy-Stack?

The docker proxy stack is primarily a toolkit for local web development that supports

1. SSL (`https://`) for all local projects.
1. descriptive names instead of `localhost`.
1. running multiple projects at the same time
1. an easy initial setup
1. adding as much "global service" docker containers as you like
1. optional catching E-Mails via SMTP with mailcatcher

Its tools are based on the [nginx-proxy](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/nginx-proxy) from Jason Wilder and contributors.
